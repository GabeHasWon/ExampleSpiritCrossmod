---- Spirit Crossmod ----
by Team Spirit

This mod aims to showcase some of Spirit Reforged's crossmod capabilities.
At the moment, this mod showcases our conversion API through a custom (and very simple) "Irradiated" biome conversion for the Savanna.
It also showcases how to effectively use a modReference or, when possible, Mod.Calls without a reference to do so.
